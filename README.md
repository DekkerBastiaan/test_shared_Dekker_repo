Shared repo to exchange/share code in organized manner

We need a place for the whole lab to share and exchange some small scripts, usage patterns, jupyter notebooks etc.
This place has to be visible to everyone, yet safe enough, so that one user wouldn't modify/erase work of another user without permission/notification.

It looks like, having a single shared repo on GitHub with several branches dedicated to different users is a way to fulfill our dreams.
Mechanism that would allow us to accomplish that is describe here:
